# Python Development Internship at Cognorise Infotech

This repository contains the projects developed during my Python development internship at Cognorise Infotech. The internship provided hands-on experience in creating GUI applications and utilizing various Python libraries.

## Projects

### Task 1: Calculator App
Developed a GUI-based calculator using the `tkinter` library.

Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear and delete functionality

Built a password generator that creates passwords based on user inputs like length and number of passwords.

Features:
- Generates passwords of specified length
- Allows the user to choose the number of passwords to generate
- Provides a mix of letters, digits, and special characters

Usage:
1. Run the `password_generator.py` script.
2. Input the desired password length and number of passwords.
3. Click the button to generate passwords.

### Task 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors
Developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the `random` library.

Features:
- Allows the user to play against the computer
- Randomly generates the computer's choice
- Determines the winner based on the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors

Usage:
1. Run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` script.
2. Select Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play against the computer.

### Task 5: Countdown Timer
Implemented a GUI-based countdown timer with `tkinter`, `messagebox`, `time`, and `threading`.

Features:
- User-friendly interface to set the countdown time
- Displays the remaining time
- Alerts the user when the time is up

Usage:
1. Run the `countdown_timer.py` script.
2. Set the desired countdown time and start the timer.
